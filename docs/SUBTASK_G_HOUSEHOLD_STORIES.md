# Reusable Recommendation Templates (for Different Personas)

## Template A – Credit Card Heavy Household
**When to use:** Multiple high-interest credit cards.
- Consider prioritizing higher APR debts first (Avalanche) to reduce total interest.
- Cutting 5–10% of discretionary spending and redirecting it to debt can shorten payoff timelines.

## Template B – Income Shock Scenario
**When to use:** Income reduction (temporary job change, fewer hours).
- Maintain minimum debt payments where possible and reduce discretionary categories.
- Track monthly surplus/deficit and adjust spending to avoid prolonged negative savings.

## Template C – Expense Spike Scenario
**When to use:** Sudden increase in expenses (rent increase, medical bill).
- Separate fixed vs variable expenses and reduce variable spend first.
- Look for renegotiation opportunities in fixed costs to stabilize the baseline budget.
